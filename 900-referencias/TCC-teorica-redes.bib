abstract = {The world of home automation is an exciting field that has exploded with new technologies and today is known as an area where “The internet of things” (IoT) vision becomes reality. The primary advantages that stem from this concept include how each device forms a small part of the Internet, by which the advanced system is able to interact and communicate, maximizes safety, security, comfort, convenience and energy-savings. This paper proposes an implementation of Sensor Web node as a part of IoT using a Raspberry Pi – inexpensive, fully customizable and programmable small computer with support for a large number of peripherals and network communication. Using this technology, in an example of monitoring and determining the confidence of fire in building, a full system, based on Sensor Web elements, is created and developed starting from a scratch. The given example confirms the advantage of Raspberry Pi – flexibility and extensive possibility of its usage.},

abstract = {In a ubiquitous computing environment, location awareness is a basic necessity. There are various research projects, which discuss the problem of indoor location sensing. We have recognized acceptability, low power consumption, and cost as the key design factors for developing widely deployable location sensing systems. As a good candidate technology that could satisfy these needs, we proposed a location sensing system based on the widely available Bluetooth medium. Location evaluation is preformed by sensing Bluetooth signal strength with a reference model based approach. We discuss problems which arise when the Bluetooth RSSI (received signal strength indicator) is used as a signal strength indicator, and propose a novel access point that supports variable attenuators to overcome these problems. This access point allows the reading of a wider range of signal strengths using RSSI. We show that our approach to location sensing has reduced the error rate about threefold compared to systems which do not use variable attenuator supported access points.},

abstract = {This paper presents the experimental evaluation of a Bluetooth-based positioning system. The method has been implemented in a Bluetooth-capable handheld device. Empirical tests of the developed considered positioning system have been realized in different indoor scenarios. The range estimation of the positioning system is based on an approximation of the between relation the RSSI (Radio Signal Strength Indicator) and the associated distance between sender and receiver. The actual location estimation is carried out by using the triangulation method. The implementation of the positioning system in a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) has been realized by using the Software "Microsoft eMbedded Visual C++ Version 3.0”.},

@inproceedings{Hossain2007,
abstract = {We provide an elaborate discussion on Bluetooth signal parameters with respect to localization, whereby we collectively designate all types of Bluetooth specification parameters that are related to signal strength - such as RSSI, Link Quality, Received and Transmit Power Level - as Bluetooth signal, parameters. According to our analysis and experimental results, "RSSI" and "Transmit Power Level" turn out to be poor candidates for localization, while "Link Quality" has its limitations. On the other hand, "Received Power Level" correlates nicely with distance, which makes it the most desirable Bluetooth signal parameter to be used in location systems. We contend that it is vital to choose the appropriate signal parameter in Bluetooth location systems, and we expect our work to provide useful pointers in any future design of such systems. Existing systems can also benefit by adopting the appropriate Bluetooth signal parameter in their systems, and thereby, improve their location accuracy.},

Bluetooth is oriented to connecting close devices, serving as a substitute for cables, while Wi-Fi is oriented toward computer-to-computer connections, as an extension of or substitution for cabled LANs. In this article we offer an overview of these popular wireless communication standards, comparing their main features and behaviors in terms of various metrics, including capacity, network topology, security, quality of service support, and power consumption.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of distance measurement in indoor IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal Propagation Time (SPT) have been widely used for distance estimation in indoor WLAN deployments. However, neither approach by itself is accurate. Moreover, there is no mean by which WLAN nodes know whether the estimated distance is accurate or not. In this work we propose a multi-measurement approach. Specifically, we combine an RSSI and a propagation time-based schemes and utilize both results for mutual cross-validation to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the number of false decisions based on errored estimations. The performance of our combined mechanism has been evaluated through real experiments.},

In this article, the IEEE 802.11 protocol is explained, with particular emphasis on the medium access control sublayer. Performance results are provided for packetized data and a combination of packetized data and voice over the WLAN. Our performance investigation reveals that an IEEE 802.11 network may be able to carry traffic with time-bounded requirements using the point coordination function. However, our findings suggest that packetized voice traffic must be handled in conjunction with an echo canceler},
