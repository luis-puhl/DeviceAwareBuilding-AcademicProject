abstract = {The model view controller (MVC) is a fundamental design pattern for the separation between user interface logic and business logic. Since applications are very large in size these days and the MVC design pattern can weak the coupling among the different application tiers of application. this paper presents a web application framework based on MVC in J2EE platform, and extends it with XML so that the framework is more flexible, expansible and easy to maintain. This is a multi tier system including presentation layer, business layer, data persistence layer and database layer. This separate codes, and improve maintainability and reusability of the application. In this paper, we implemented MVC using spring and struts framework. Our research study show that applying multiple framework to design the applications using MVC concepts makes applications easier compare to a single framework.},

abstract = {In biology teaching, ecological subjects play an important role in dealing with nature in a responsible way. Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students' conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: 'scientific clarification', 'comprehension of students' perspectives' and 'construction of instruction'. In order to capture the structure and quality of students' conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.},

@article{Dey2000,
abstract = {Traditional interactive applications are limited to using only the input that users explicitly provide. As users move away from traditional desktop computing environments and move towards mobile and ubiquitous computing environments, there is a greater need for applications to leverage from implicit information, or context. These types of environments are rich in context, with users and devices moving around and computational services becoming available or disappearing over time. This information is usually not available to applications but can be useful in adapting the way in which it performs its services and in changing the available services. Applications that use context are known as context-aware applications. This research in context-aware computing has focused on the development of a software architecture to support the building of context-aware applications. While developers have been able to build context-aware applications, they have been limited to using a small variety of sensors that provide only simple context such as identity and location. This dissertation presents a set of requirements and component abstractions for a conceptual supporting framework. The framework along with an identified design process makes it easier to acquire and deliver context to applications, and in turn, build more complex context-aware applications. In addition, an implementation of the framework called the Context Toolkit is discussed, along with a number of context-aware applications that have been built with it. The applications illustrate how the toolkit is used in practice and allows an exploration of the design space of context-aware computing. This dissertation also shows how the Context Toolkit has been used as a research testbed, supporting the investigation of difficult problems in context-aware computing such as the building of high-level programming abstractions, dealing with ambiguous or inaccurate context data and controlling access to personal context.},

abstract = {The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it. Consider writing, perhaps the first information technology: The ability to capture a symbolic representation of spoken language for long-term storage freed information from the limits of individual memory. Today this technology is ubiquitous in industrialized countries. Not only do books, magazines and newspapers convey written information, but so do street signs, billboards, shop signs and even graffiti. Candy wrappers are covered in writing. The constant background presence of these products of "literacy technology" does not require active attention, but the information to be conveyed is ready for use at a glance. It is difficult to imagine modern life otherwise. Silicon-based information technology, in contrast, is far from having become part of the environment. More than 50 million personal computers have been sold, and nonetheless the computer remains largely in a world of its own. It is approachable only through complex jargon that has nothing to do with the tasks for which which people actually use computers. The state of the art is perhaps analogous to the period when scribes had to know as much about making ink or baking clay as they did about writing.},

The received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal Propagation Time (SPT) have been widely used for distance estimation in indoor WLAN deployments. However, neither approach by itself is accurate. Moreover, there is no mean by which WLAN nodes know whether the estimated distance is accurate or not. In this work we propose a multi-measurement approach. Specifically, we combine an RSSI and a propagation time-based schemes and utilize both results for mutual cross-validation to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the number of false decisions based on errored estimations. The performance of our combined mechanism has been evaluated through real experiments.},

abstract = {Currently in development, numerous geolocation technologies can pinpoint a person's or object's position on the Earth. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of wireless callers will facilitate the planning, design, and operation of next generation broadband wireless networks. Mobile users will gain the ability to get local traffic information and detailed directions to gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and other services. Police and rescue teams will be able to quickly and precisely locate people who are lost or injured but cannot give their precise location. Companies will use geolocation based applications to track personnel, vehicles, and other assets. The driving force behind the development of this technology is a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate stating that by 1 October 2001 all wireless carriers must provide the geolocation of an emergency 911 caller to the appropriate public safety answering point. Location technologies requiring new modified, or upgraded mobile stations must determine the caller's longitude and latitude within 50 meters for 67 percent of emergency calls, and within 150 meters for 95 percent of the calls. Otherwise, they must do so within 100 meters and 300 meters, respectively, for the same percentage of calls. Currently deployed wireless technology can locate 911 calls within an area no smaller than 10 to 15 square kilometers. It is argued that assisted-GPS technology offers superior accuracy, availability, and coverage at a reasonable cost},

abstract = {Traditional interactive applications are limited to using only the input that users explicitly provide. As users move away from traditional desktop computing environments and move towards mobile and ubiquitous computing environments, there is a greater need for applications to leverage from implicit information, or context. These types of environments are rich in context, with users and devices moving around and computational services becoming available or disappearing over time. This information is usually not available to applications but can be useful in adapting the way in which it performs its services and in changing the available services. Applications that use context are known as context-aware applications. This research in context-aware computing has focused on the development of a software architecture to support the building of context-aware applications. While developers have been able to build context-aware applications, they have been limited to using a small variety of sensors that provide only simple context such as identity and location. This dissertation presents a set of requirements and component abstractions for a conceptual supporting framework. The framework along with an identified design process makes it easier to acquire and deliver context to applications, and in turn, build more complex context-aware applications. In addition, an implementation of the framework called the Context Toolkit is discussed, along with a number of context-aware applications that have been built with it. The applications illustrate how the toolkit is used in practice and allows an exploration of the design space of context-aware computing. This dissertation also shows how the Context Toolkit has been used as a research testbed, supporting the investigation of difficult problems in context-aware computing such as the building of high-level programming abstractions, dealing with ambiguous or inaccurate context data and controlling access to personal context.},

abstract = {In a ubiquitous computing environment, location awareness is a basic necessity. There are various research projects, which discuss the problem of indoor location sensing. We have recognized acceptability, low power consumption, and cost as the key design factors for developing widely deployable location sensing systems. As a good candidate technology that could satisfy these needs, we proposed a location sensing system based on the widely available Bluetooth medium. Location evaluation is preformed by sensing Bluetooth signal strength with a reference model based approach. We discuss problems which arise when the Bluetooth RSSI (received signal strength indicator) is used as a signal strength indicator, and propose a novel access point that supports variable attenuators to overcome these problems. This access point allows the reading of a wider range of signal strengths using RSSI. We show that our approach to location sensing has reduced the error rate about threefold compared to systems which do not use variable attenuator supported access points.},

According to our analysis and experimental results, "RSSI" and "Transmit Power Level" turn out to be poor candidates for localization, while "Link Quality" has its limitations. On the other hand, "Received Power Level" correlates nicely with distance, which makes it the most desirable Bluetooth signal parameter to be used in location systems. We contend that it is vital to choose the appropriate signal parameter in Bluetooth location systems, and we expect our work to provide useful pointers in any future design of such systems. Existing systems can also benefit by adopting the appropriate Bluetooth signal parameter in their systems, and thereby, improve their location accuracy.},

@article{Bellavista2008,
abstract = {Gainesville, Florida, 10 March 2 012. Today, the Mobile Location- Based Services Summit hosted a panel entitled "What Was Wrong with First-Generation Location-Based Services?" The panel chair, Sumi Helal of the University of Florida, invited two world-class experts in LBS history and technology to discuss the topic: Paolo Bellavista of the University of Bologna and Axel Kupper of the University of Munich. The panel discussed the popularity of today's LBSs and analyzed their distinguishing aspects in comparison with first-generation LBSs. The panel was anything but controversial, with all panelists in total agreement on what initially went wrong and why today's LBSs work. They analyzed how the failure unfolded to set the stage for a major paradigm shift in LBS business and technology and noted the milestones that shaped today's LBSs.},

@article{Vasisht,
abstract = {– We present Chronos, a system that enables a single WiFi access point to localize clients to within tens of centimeters. Such a system can bring indoor position-ing to homes and small businesses which typically have a single access point. The key enabler underlying Chronos is a novel algo-rithm that can compute sub-nanosecond time-of-flight us-ing commodity WiFi cards. By multiplying the time-of-flight with the speed of light, a MIMO access point com-putes the distance between each of its antennas and the client, hence localizing it. Our implementation on com-modity WiFi cards demonstrates that Chronos's accu-racy is comparable to state-of-the-art localization systems, which use four or five access points.},
